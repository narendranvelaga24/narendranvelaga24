## 🚀 About Me

Hello there! My name is Narendran, and I am an engineering student passionate about web development and programming. 💻 I have a strong grasp of languages like C/C++, Java, and JavaScript, and I am enthusiastic about gaining more experience in these areas.

Currently, I am looking to enhance my skills and I am open to opportunities that allow me to contribute to exciting projects and learn from experienced professionals.

In my free time, I enjoy watching movies and anime, as well as reading manga. I especially appreciate works by Naoki Urasawa, such as 20𝘵𝘩 𝘊𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘺 𝘉𝘰𝘺𝘴 and 𝘔𝘰𝘯𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘳. I am always eager to connect and learn! ☺️
